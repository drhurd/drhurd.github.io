When people ask me what I like about being a Computer Science major, I always say it's because I love to build things. So for the rest of the summer, I'm going to build. A lot.

The best way to get better at programming is, just like every other skill I've come across, to practice. Until the end of July, I'm going to make a new project every week. Track me on [github](https://github.com/drhurd) - hopefully I'll build something cool enough to use.
