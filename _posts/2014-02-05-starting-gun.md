In case you didn't check the dates, it's been a month since my last (first?) addition.  Clearly, I haven't been paying much attention to my homepage. To be fair though, I have been [pretty busy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtuvTNA6MgM).

Starting this week though, I'm setting deadlines.  I will be posting once a week from here on out (this post won't count).  2014 better be interesting or I'm in for a trip.
