title: Taking Action Together
---

Part of being a good ally is taking action. Starting today, through this weekend, I’ll match up to $500 in donations to the [Equal Justice Initiative](https://eji.org) or the [NAACP](https://www.naacp.org).  Airbnb matches each employee’s every year, up to $1000. So I’ll match your donation, and Airbnb will match both our money. Together, we can contribute $2000 to organizations working to dismantle systemic racism.

*If you’ve considered donating, but aren’t sure that you can make a difference, this will 4x your impact.*

Feel free to DM me on Twitter [@dr_hurd](https://twitter.com/dr_hurd). My one ask, whether or not you choose to donate with me, is that if you are reading this, you register to vote, and that you vote in your local and state elections. It is one of many actions you can take, but this one is free. As [President Obama described in a recent Medium post](https://medium.com/@BarackObama/how-to-make-this-moment-the-turning-point-for-real-change-9fa209806067), young voters are terribly underrepresented in elections that have much more impact on their lives than they realize.
