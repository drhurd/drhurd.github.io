title: Lessons Learned in 2017
---
I had the opportunity to grow and change a lot in 2017. I took on some big engineering projects,and spent most of the year learning how to be a Product Manager. These are just a few of the most valuable lessons I learned along the way.

1. Admit when you’re wrong. If someone else was right, tell them. Doing so will build trust and help you focus on your common goal.
2. If you have to make a decision with which someone on your team disagrees, make sure they know you understand their reasoning.
3. Silence and eye contact are powerful communication tools. If you wait and listen, you’ll hear more. More eye contact will make your words more impactful.
4. Instead of saying sorry, say thank you. Instead of “sorry I’m late,” say “thanks for waiting.” (Courtesy of  [Yao Xiao](https://www.instagram.com/p/-o7hlQFD0d/))
5. If you need people to remember something, you need to tell them more than once.
6. Speak less and say more.
7. Asking great questions requires critical thinking. Do not take information at face value. Always ask why.
8. Even if something isn’t your fault, it can still be your responsibility.
9. Practice something you’re bad at. Being bad at a new skill or hobby is the only way to pick it up.
10. Invest in your mental health. Take the time to take care of yourself. It will make a huge difference.
