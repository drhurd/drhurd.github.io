It remains to be seen whether the 21st century US government can accomplish anything of meaning. Lobbyist money far outweighs voter opinion, and (as of 2014) approval ratings are abysmal.  The 20th century was marked by amazing feats that put current government officials to shame.

Sending a man to the moon in the name of science. Major civil rights reform in the name of equality. Construction of an interstate highway system in the name of connecting the country.

The great project of the 21st century is staring Congress right in the face: the internet. Our internet speeds are terrible compared to many other developed countries. Our overpriced and monopolistic price structures serves only to fill the corrupt pockets of Comcast, Time Warner, and other telecom companies that have repeatedly attempted to undermin the very principles upon which the internet is based.

Google is attempting to alleviate this problem by introducing Google Fiber in select cities, which offers Gigabyte *[bit or byte?]* level speeds for 70 dollars a month. Major telcos have responded by lobbying for legislation that would make it essentially impossible for their service to expand profitably.

What we need is ambition from our representatives. Ambition is not squandering a term in office supporting only lobbyist bills to raise campaign funds. Ambition is relentlessly pursuing the improvement of America. Ambition is building a national fiber network.

An enormous cost? Maybe. But the benefits of such a network would be immeasurable. If online innovation is revolutionizing American with the current level of access, imagine what universal access to information could do.  Why move to Silicon Valley when you can video conference in high quality and stay closer to your primary customer base?

Many people would call me a fool for believing the government to be capable of such a feat. But we've accomplished great things before. We need to demand more of Congress than terrible legislation and wholly unproductive Congressional terms. Demand ambition. Demand more great feats.
