It's becoming more and more apparent that [blogs and personal sites are replacing resumes](https://medium.com/desktop-diaries/b90eec4f928). I've always liked the idea of a blog, but cowered at the thought of posting anything boring or poorly-written or offensive or [unprofessional](http://www.allenpike.com/2013/unprofessionalism/). Something about the New Year has me feeling adventurous though, so I'm taking the plunge and curating my online persona. 

The intention is less blog and more catalogue of my skills and efforts. I have several drafts of more traditional posts/essays gathering dust on [Medium](http://medium.com) because of the same excuses I used to avoid putting this page up. My resolution is to have this page brimming with content \(including those medium posts\) by year's end, and show the internet that I am much more than my Twitter tagline or my LinkedIn profile - not to mention inject some life into my writing.
